The QUADRATURE Project has 7 work packages (WPs), 5 of which are technical and are briefly described as follows:
<br/>
# WP1: Quantum Coherent Link
<br/>
Integration of quantum communication links with quantum computational functions in the microwave and mm-wave frequency range is the key requirement for the scaling of quantum computing platforms. In this WP, the quantum cavity channel and its monolithic integration into Qcore solutions will be modeled, fabricated and characterized. 
<br/> 

# WP2: Cryogenic Wireless Link
<br/>
develops the deep-cryogenic transceiver for inter-Qcore classical communication, tightly coupled with quantum coherent link (WP1), wireless control plane (WP3), and the quantum architecture (WP4). In detail, the aim is the experimental demonstration of deep-cryogenic (1-4K) short-range (~10cm) communication using the developed high-efficiency (<100 mW/core) transceiver co-integrated with on-chip (< 0.1 mm2) mm-wave antennas. The transmitter aims for 1 mW output power at above 60 GHz with a data rate >2 Gbps, while the receiver aims for <20 K noise temperature and compatibility with on-chip antennas and the 60GHz/2Gbps transmitter.
<br/>

# WP3: Communications within Quantum Package
<br/>
WP3 develops the quantum communications plane operating within the quantum package, enabled by the tight interplay between the quantum coherent links (WP1) and the associated wireless links at cryogenic temperatures (WP2), while bound to the requirements of the quantum architecture (WP4). In detail, the aims are:
<br/>
+ To model the capacity of cryogenic wireless links, as well as potential interference with qubit state transfer and
operation, through a characterization of the wireless channels within the quantum package.
<br/>
+ To develop a full stack of protocols including scheduling and network orchestration, which allow to manage
many concurrent quantum state transfers through the quantum links controlled via the wireless network.
<br/>
+ To obtain performance and efficiency models to be integrated in the system architecture and algorithm analysis.


# WP4: Quantum System Architecture
<br/>
This WP defines the multi-Qcore distributed architecture and development of corresponding optimised mapping solutions for a set of representative and relevant quantum applications. More specifically:
<br/>
+ To design a parameterizable and reconfigurable multi-Qcore platform.
+ To develop mapping and scheduling methodologies and on-line inter-Qcore connectivity optimization.
<br/>

# WP5: Model-Based Cross-Layer Architecture Simulation and Benchmarking
<br/>
WP5 aims at designing, architecting and evaluating the wireless-enabled double full-stack quantum system by means of a model-based cross-layer system architecture simulation framework, in particular:
<br/>
+ To derive optimal configurations of the double full-stack, dimensioning guidelines and scalability trends.
+ To perform an architecture-application co-design of the communication and computational stacks.
