QUADRATURE is an EU-funded project that aims to take a bold step towards **creating post-NISQ massive quantum processors through the development of scalable architectures with multiple Qcores interconnected via quantum-coherent links within the cryogenic package.**

<br />
The project is a collaboration between several universities and industries such as [Universitat Politechnica de Valencia](https://www.upv.es/en), [Universitat Politechnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/ca), [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), [University of Siegen](https://www.uni-siegen.de/start/), [Universita Degli Studi di Catania](https://www.unict.it/), [Equal1 Laboratories, Ireland](https://www.equal1.com/), [the Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/), [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/), and the [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).
