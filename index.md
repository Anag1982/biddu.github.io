QUADRATURE is an EU-funded project that aims to take a bold step towards **creating post-NISQ massive quantum processors through the development of scalable architectures with multiple Qcores interconnected via quantum-coherent links within the cryogenic package.**

<br />
The project is a collaboration between several universities and industries such as [Universitat Politechnica de Valencia](https://www.upv.es/en), [Universitat Politechnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/ca), [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), [University of Siegen](https://www.uni-siegen.de/start/), [Universita Degli Studi di Catania](https://www.unict.it/), [Equal1 Laboratories, Ireland](https://www.equal1.com/), [the Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/), [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/), and the [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). 


## QUADRATURE Vision
<br/>

The QUADRATURE project aims to **take a bold step towards creating post-NISQ massive quantum processors through the development of scalable architectures with multiple Qcores interconnected via quantum-coherent links within the cryogenic package.** This is only possible by providing a quantum- coherent alternative to the rigid, static and wire-crowded interconnects that are nowadays commonplace in quantum computers. Specifically, an ideal multi-Qcore interconnect fabric should not only support many simultaneous quantum state transfers across the Qcores, but also include a complementary control fabric capable of orchestrating such quantum-coherent exchanges. If realized, this would unleash the architectural scalability potential of quantum computers by virtue of a balanced adaptive tradeoff between communication and computation functions. In summary:
<br/>
The vision of QUADRATURE is the **realization of million-qubit quantum computing architectures able to address real-world problems otherwise intractable with conventional computers. Such architectures would be based on a modular and scalable multi-Qcore approach enabled by a quantum-coherent network within the cryogenic package.** The figure below highlights the architectural vision of QUADRATURE.
